README, radiometricCalibration project.

This project is my own implementation of the following paper:

S.Lin, J.Gu, S.Yamazaki, and H.-Y. Shum. Radiometric calibration from a single image. 
In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2004.

In general, I found it very hard to obtain stable and reliable results across
a large variety of images without having to tweak the parameters. Let me know
if you find a good way around this!


== GETTING STARTED ==

1. Modify the 'basePath' in 'getPathName.m' to match your setup;
2. Run 'setPath';
3. Run 'demoRadiometricCalibration.m';
4. That's it!
